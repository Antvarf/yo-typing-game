        for each player:
                update:

                                * incorrectly
        * record creation and start time

for each player:
        * output creation date


future:
        - refactor process_word to be base class method calling .unique_effects after applying common changes

endpoints:
        * /api/sessions/<session_id>/ should return all player results now
        * /api/players/<player_id>/ should return all player data and sessions now
